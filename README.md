How much time did you put into this task? 
I worked on this homework for about two hours, mostly on developing the code for matrix operations and grasping the idea of a sparse matrix.

What letter grade would you say you received for your effort? 
I would say that, considering my work, I received an A as I made the required time investments and made sure the code is organized properly.

Which grade would you say you received based on your solution? 
I think I received a B+ for the answer since there were several edge situations that I couldn't fully manage, such combining matrices with various dimensions.

What doesn't work, and what steps did you take to try to fix it? 
I didn't know how to upload the file initially, but later on i solved it.
